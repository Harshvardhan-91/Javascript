console.log("Hello this is javascript");

let a = 5;
let b = 6;
let c = "Harsh";

console.log(a + b);
console.log(typeof a, typeof b, typeof c);

const a1 = 6; //now a1 can't be changed
//a1 = a1 + 6 --> Not allowed

//var vs let-----------------

//most of the time we will use let instead of var
// let is blocked scoped while var is globally scoped

//Primitve data types are basic datatypes in javascript like NULL, Number, Undefined , String , Symbol , Boolean

//Objects are non primitive datatypes
